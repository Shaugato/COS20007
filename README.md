# COS20007
Object Oriented Programming 
Learning outcome:

1.Explain the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. They will understand how OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes objects as the primary units of software design and development.

2.Use an object-oriented programming language and associated class libraries to develop OOP programs. They will be able to create objects, define classes, implement inheritance, and use polymorphism to create efficient and modular code.

3.Use an object-oriented programming language and associated class libraries to develop OOP programs. They will be able to create objects, define classes, implement inheritance, and use polymorphism to create efficient and modular code.

4.Design, develop, test, and debug programs using object-oriented principles in conjunction with an integrated development environment (IDE). They will be able to apply OOP concepts and principles to solve programming problems, and use IDEs to streamline the development process.

5.Construct appropriate diagrams and textual descriptions to communicate the static structure and dynamic behavior of an object-oriented solution. They will be able to create UML diagrams, such as class diagrams and sequence diagrams, to communicate the structure and behavior of an OOP solution.

6.Describe and explain the factors that contribute to a good object-oriented solution, reflecting on their own experiences and drawing upon accepted good practices. They will understand how OOP design patterns, SOLID principles, and code reusability can contribute to creating effective and efficient OOP solutions. They will also be able to evaluate and reflect on their own OOP design decisions, using accepted best practices to guide their choices.
